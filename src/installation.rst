Installation guide
==================

You've seen https://digitransit.fi and some instances like
https://digitransit.im.verschwoerhaus.de https://mobil-in-herrenberg.de
https://digitransit.codeformuenster.org https://cityrouting.e-gpp.hr
https://next-dev.oulunliikenne.fi. Now you're interested in how to get a
digitransit for your own region. This could be a helpful step-by-step
guide for you :)

If you attempt building your own deployment for the first time, budget for a few hours. With a bit of experience, deployment times of about half an hour are realistic.

Ingredients
-----------

-  One host machine with a-little-bit-more-than-average RAM (i.e. 16+ GB) for
   building the :term:`OTP data container` and :term:`digitransit-ui`
-  One Kubernetes Cluster (can be single-node) with 8+ GB RAM
-  `kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>`__
   installed and configured on your (personal) device for controlling
   said Kubernetes Cluster. (The following tasks _can_ be performed without
   kubectl, but we highly discourage it.)
-  One OpenStreetMap extract for your region (see:
   https://download.geofabrik.de)
-  One (or more) :term:`GTFS` Feeds for public transit routes
-  A GitHub Account (for forking stuff)
-  A Docker Hub Account (for publishing your containers)
-  One Domain and access to DNS for creating a subdomain

optional
~~~~~~~~

-  One (or more) :term:`GBFS` Feeds (for bikesharing and/or carsharing)

Overview
--------

digitransit is a slightly complex system composed of multiple services
in container that talk to each other. A nice architecture image can be
found at the `digitransit.fi
documentation <https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/architecture/>`__.

The main components of an digitransit deployment consists of:

-  Multimodal routing engine (:term:`OpenTripPlanner`)
-  Address search (originally :term:`pelias`)
-  Background map service (:term:`hsl-map-server`: [tessera], [tilelive])
-  Web browser-based user interface (:term:`digitransit-ui`)

A nicer description of the components and their job exists also at
https://digitransit.fi/en/services/


.. blockdiag::

   diagram {

     tileserver [label="OSM Tile Server"];
     datacontainer [label="OTP Data Container"];
     gtfs [label="GTFS", stacked];
     gbfs [label="GBFS", stacked];
     osmgraph [label="OSM Street Graph"];
     otp [label="OpenTripPlanner"];

     tessera [label="tessera", style="dashed"];
     tilelive [label="tilelive", style="dashed"];
     dui [label="digitransit-ui"];

     tileserver, pelias -> dui;
     gtfs, gbfs, osmgraph -> datacontainer -> otp -> dui;
     otp, tessera, tilelive -> hslmap -> dui;

     otp -> hslmap [folded];
   }

.. note:: 
     As can be seen in the diagram, some dependencies are circular. This poses a few challenges when first setting up a working instance, which we will address later on.

Step-by-Step
------------

0. Preparing your build host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need on your build host:

- docker-ce runtime
- git
- nodejs, LTS version
- yarn

.. note:: This should be enhanced with copy-pasteable commands

1. Building an OpenTripPlanner Graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the end of this part, you will end up with a working :term:`OTP data container`. The process works by providing :term:`OpenTripPlanner` with the necessary base data and using it to build the graph that will later be used by OTP to perform routing queries against.

.. important::
    Make sure that the graph is being built with the same version
    of OpenTripPlanner that will later on be used to perform the
    actual queries.

You need: 

- One (or more) :term:`GTFS` Feed with a publicly accessible URL
  (if you only have a :term:`GTFS` zip file, upload it somewhere
  public)
- One OpenStreetMap extract for your region in .pbf format,
  accessible at a public URL - try https://download.geofabrik.de 
- if you need to merge two regions, try
  `osmium merge <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/242704/merging-osm-pbf-files>`__

For the configuration, find and memorize a short identifier. You
need this often. In our example, we use ``ulm``.

Method 1: vsh-style modifying of opentripplanner-data-container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: 
    This method is deprecated as of 2020-06 and is only
    preserved for archival reasons. Please skip ahead to 
    `Method 2: muenster-style custom container`_

Check out `HSLdevcom/OpenTripPlanner-data-container <https://github.com/HSLdevcom/OpenTripPlanner-data-container>`__

``git clone https://github.com/HSLdevcom/OpenTripPlanner-data-container``

Copy the ``router-waltti`` folder to ``router-ulm`` (replace ``ulm``
with your :term:`GTFS` identifier). Inside ``router-ulm``, edit
``build-config.js``

::

    {
      "areaVisibility": true,
      "parentStopLinking": true,
      "osmWayPropertySet": "default",
      "elevationUnitMultiplier": 0.1
    }

(Remove stuff like ``"fares": "HSL",``, this is not relevant outside of
finland).

Also edit ``router-config.js``. The ``routingDefaults`` are mostly okay.
If you are not satisfied with the routing suggestions, try to modify
these values. ``updaters`` are for realtime updates to feeds (think:
GTFS-RT) or :term:`GBFS` (Bikesharing, Carsharing) status updates. If you don't
have these, simply replace it with ``updaters: []``. Your
``router-config.js`` could look like this:

::

    {
      "routingDefaults": {
          "walkSpeed": 1.3,
          "transferSlack": 120,
          "maxTransfers": 4,
          "waitReluctance": 0.95,
          "waitAtBeginningFactor": 0.7,
          "walkReluctance": 1.75,
          "stairsReluctance": 1.65,
          "walkBoardCost": 540,
          "itineraryFiltering": 1.0,
          "maxSlope": 0.125
      },
      "updaters": []
    }

In the main directory, edit the ``config.js`` and add a new
``ULM_CONFIG`` like the ``HSL_CONFIG``. Insert your :term:`GTFS` URL. For
example like this:

::

    const ULM_CONFIG = {
      'id': 'ulm',
      'src': [
        src('DING', 'https://www.nvbw.de/fileadmin/nvbw/open-data/Fahrplandaten_mit_Liniennetz/ding.zip', false),
      ],
      'osm': 'ulm',
      // 'dem': 'hsl' // we don't have a Digital Elevation Model
    }

In the ``setCurrentConfig`` method, you need to add your thusly created
config to ``ALL_CONFIGS``, like this:

::

    const setCurrentConfig = (name) => {
      ALL_CONFIGS = [WALTTI_CONFIG, HSL_CONFIG, FINLAND_CONFIG, ULM_CONFIG].reduce((acc, nxt) => {

Add your OSM extract to the osm config near the end of the file:

::

    const osm = [
      { id: 'finland', url: 'https://karttapalvelu.storage.hsldev.com/finland.osm/finland.osm.pbf' },
      { id: 'hsl', url: 'https://karttapalvelu.storage.hsldev.com/hsl.osm/hsl.osm.pbf' },
      { id: 'ulm', url: 'https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/baden-wuerttemberg/tuebingen-regbez-latest.osm.pbf' }
    ]

Modify ``Dockerfile`` to include your ``router-ulm`` directory: ``ADD router-hsl /opt/otp-data-builder/router-hsl ADD router-waltti /opt/otp-data-builder/router-waltti ADD router-ulm /opt/otp-data-builder/router-ulm``

Modify ``gulpfile.js`` to include your router configuration in the build
process. Near the end of the file,
``gulp.task('router:buildGraph', ...`` has a list of pipes that we need
to add to:

.. code:: diff

    gulp.task('router:buildGraph', gulp.series('router:copy', function () {
      gulp.src(['otp-data-container/*', 'otp-data-container/.*'])
        .pipe(gulp.dest(`${config.dataDir}/build/waltti`))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(`${config.dataDir}/build/finland`))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(`${config.dataDir}/build/hsl`))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(`${config.dataDir}/build/ulm`))

.. todo:: provide patch for SKIP\_SEED

Until PR #XX <> is merged, we have to apply this patch, to support
skipping the seed-step hsl is using to keep rebuilding the
otp-data-container periodically. In our case, a fresh setup starting
without an old container we could seed from, this sadly breaks every
time.

Apply by executing
``curl https://github.com/HSLdevcom/OpenTripPlanner-data-container/commit/d657285fd2f73f11bedb9478be6880607b5b9733.patch | git apply``

And now, we can finally build our own ``opentripplanner-data-container``!

- Run ``npm install``
- Run ``ROUTERS=ulm ORG=verschwoerhaus SKIP_SEED=true node index.js once``
  (Set ``ROUTERS=`` to your config identifier, set ``ORG`` to your docker
  hub username or organization)
- Note the opentripplanner version the graph gets built with and save
  this information for later use. You can see this in the testing step
  of the build in a line like this:

::

    22:42:55.917 INFO (Graph.java:752) OTP version:   MavenVersion(1, 5, 0, SNAPSHOT, da7ca2a4d5a8cb381cd64efc6df5ba4252d45440)

This OTP version is also the version of otp that has to run to ingest
the data container again - and is needed for the container image tag of
otp below when building the kubernetes config.

After running the command (this could take a few minutes), you should
see a new image appear in ``docker images``:

::

    REPOSITORY                                          TAG                                        IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
    hsldevcom/opentripplanner-data-container-ulm        test                                       9742c641ad50        2 minutes ago      209MB

You can now retag this image with your docker hub organization and
correct tag and push it to docker hub:

::

    docker tag hsldevcom/opentripplanner-data-container-ulm:test verschwoerhaus/opentripplanner-data-container-ulm:2020-01-21
    docker push verschwoerhaus/opentripplanner-data-container-ulm:2020-01-21

Method 2: muenster-style custom container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Code for MÃ¼nster <https://codeformuenster.org/>`__ inspired us to use a simpler building
process by introducing a custom dockerfile for the datacontainer.

For this, we're going to fork the `digitransit-otp-data repository <https://github.com/verschwoerhaus/digitransit-otp-data>`__.

The ``Dockerfile`` is the main file you have to edit.
Below ``# add build data`` you see a list of ``ADD`` statements. Replace these URLs with those of your GTFS and OSM dump (in the pbf format).
For the packaging, define your own ``ROUTER_NAME`` in the line ``ENV ROUTER_NAME=...``.

You can modify more graph bulding settings in the ``build-config.json``. The OpenTripPlanner Documentation contains a section about
`Graph build configuration <https://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/Configuration/#graph-build-configuration>`__, listing a lot of settings and their default values.
For the ``router-config.json`` there also exists `Documentation with description <https://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/Configuration/#runtime-router-configuration>`__ of the options and their default values.

If you have an GBFS feed, you can add an otp updater config to ``router-config.json`` like this:

::

    ...
    "updaters": [
      {
        "id": "openbike-bike-rental",
        "type": "bike-rental",
        "sourceType": "gbfs",
        "url": "https://api.openbike.ulm.dev/gbfs/",
        "frequencySec": 10,
        "network": "openbike"
      }
    ]
    ...

The building of the graph happens with the `mfdz OpenTripPlanner fork <https://github.com/mfdz/opentripplanner>`__.
It is important that the OpenTripPlanner version that builds the graph is the same that later serves the graph. If you want to update, get the latest docker image tag from the
`docker hub page of mfdz/opentripplanner <https://hub.docker.com/r/mfdz/opentripplanner/tags>`__ and modify ``OTP_VERSION`` in the Dockerfile.

For building and publishing, standard docker commands are used:

::

    docker build -t verschwoerhaus/opentripplanner-data-container-ulm:2020-01-21 .
    docker push verschwoerhaus/opentripplanner-data-container-ulm:2020-01-21


2. Building hsl-map-server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. hint:: 
   We are using :term:`hsl-map-server` only for the stop (and bike)
   overlays. The basemap *can* be rendered by this project, but so far
   we have instead been using other tile servers. 
   In the beginning, we had used `Wikimedia's tile server <https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Maps_Terms_of_Use>`__,
   but a subsequent rush of third-party users during spring of 2020
   brought that service to it's knees.
   You may configure your own (either homemade or factory-bought) tile
   server in digitransit-ui instead.

Check out `HSLdevcom/hsl-map-server <https://github.com/HSLdevcom/hsl-map-server>`__: ``git clone https://github.com/HSLdevcom/hsl-map-server``

Edit ``config.js``, modify ``module.exports`` to keep only the
``stop-map`` (and the citybike, if needed) map layer:

::

    module.exports = {
      "/map/v1/stop-map": {
        "source": `otpstops://${process.env.OTP_URL}`,
        "headers": {
          "Cache-Control": "public,max-age=43200"
        }
      },
      "/map/v1/citybike-map": {
        "source": `otpcitybikes://${process.env.OTP_URL}`,
        "headers": {
          "Cache-Control": "public,max-age=43200"
        }
      },
    }

To build, run ``docker build -t verschwoerhaus/hsl-map-server:2020-01-21 .``

Push the resulting image also into docker hub:``docker push verschwoerhaus/hsl-map-server:2020-01-21``

3. Building digitransit-proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::
    digitransit-proxy can be completely replaced by
    kubernetes-ingress-nginx. see cfm:
    https://github.com/codeformuenster/kubernetes-deployment/blob/46ea8118ff55fb2d3158d61a96e6d92ac3b951ee/sources/digitransit/ingress.yaml

nginx will not start if it cannot resolve the hostnames in its (proxy)
configuration. This is why we have to fork the digitransit proxy and
remove all the references to stuff we don't need.

See the diff at
https://github.com/HSLdevcom/digitransit-proxy/compare/master...transportkollektiv:master
for all the location config you should remove.

Note that some endpoints need your configuration name in the url, eg
``/routing/v1/routers/hsl`` â ``/routing/v1/routers/ulm``.

4. Using photon-pelias-adapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

digitransit originally uses :term:`pelias` as a geocoder: Insert address,
get geocoordinates as a result. 
Sadly, pelias is not maintained
anymore - and custom adjustments seem to be very hard. We've therefore
decided to use `photon with an
adapter <https://github.com/stadtulm/photon-pelias-adapter>`__ instead.
(Photon has also problems, especially currently not supporting :term:`GTFS` stop
imports, but this should be solveable in the long run)

The adapter is completely configurable with one ENV variable
``PHOTON_URL``. It doesn't need to be custom built.

Later, we're simply using the docker container
`stadtulm/photon-pelias-adapter from docker
hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/stadtulm/photon-pelias-adapter>`__.

5. Building digitransit-ui
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build your own digitransit user interface, you need to add a theme
and provide configuration (which includes your custom urls).

First run ``yarn install``

To create the theme files, run ``yarn run add-theme <name>`` (you could
optionally supply a color and logo, read
`documentation <https://github.com/HSLdevcom/digitransit-ui/blob/master/docs/Themes.md>`__
for more details)

In ``app/configurations/``, create your own ``config.ulm.js``. For the
configuration content, look into all the other files, preferential
``config.hsl.js``, ``waltti.js``, ``config.matka.js`` and
``config.default.js``.

You have to provide your own urls and paths with your config name, eg.
in

::

    OTP: process.env.OTP_URL || `${API_URL}/routing/v1/routers/ulm/`,
    // ...
    STOP_MAP: `${API_URL}/map/v1/stop-map/`,

Enter your used :term:`GTFS` feed ids in

::

    feedIds: ['DING'],

Configure the tile server of your choice. For testing, you might be content
using the wikimedia tile server:

::

    const MAP_URL = 'https://maps.wikimedia.org/osm-intl/';

and inside the config part:

::

    map: {
        useRetinaTiles: true,
        tileSize: 256,
        zoomOffset: 0,
    },

You also have to supply your own ``themeMap``, so your theme gets
recognized and used:

::

    themeMap: {
        ulm: 'ulm',
    },

For more config options that we set, have a look into
https://github.com/verschwoerhaus/digitransit-ui/blob/ulm/app/configurations/config.vsh.js

Finally, also create an docker image out of the ui: ``docker build -t verschwoerhaus/digitransit-ui:2020-01-21 .``
Push the resulting image to docker hub: ``docker push verschwoerhaus/digitransit-ui:2020-01-21``

6. Crafting kubernetes yaml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need:

-  access to a kubernetes cluster
-  kubectl on your device,
   with `kubeconfig <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/>`__
   for this cluster
-  Build services for each of the containers and deployments with
   the right container image tags. (Especially important for opentripplanner)

Connect the different parts to each other: 

- digitransit-ui â digitransit-proxy 
- hsl-map-server â digitransit-proxy 
- opentripplanner â digitransit-proxy 
- opentripplanner-data-container â digitransit-proxy 
- opentripplanner-data-container â opentripplanner (otp gets its graph from the data container)
- opentripplanner â hsl-map-server (mapserver gets its stop data from otp)

.. blockdiag::

   diagram {

     digitransit-ui, hsl-map-server, opentripplanner -> digitransit-proxy;
     opentripplanner-data-container -> digitransit-proxy;
     opentripplanner-data-container -> opentripplanner [folded];
     opentripplanner -> hsl-map-server [folded];
   }

.. todo:: is this order even right?!

Don't forget the environment variables for digitransit-ui (``CONFIG``)
and opentripplanner (``ROUTER_NAME``).

Have a look at this working template:
https://github.com/verschwoerhaus/digitransit-kubernetes/blob/master/all.yml

.. hint::
   Reminder: the OpenTripPlanner version has to match the version that was used to build the graph.
   Ensure you are using the same docker image tag here.

.. todo::  
   rewrite section, what services have to exist, how should they be
   named, how to get step by step to kubernetes config
.. todo::
   maybe provide existing template and only teach how to
   override/insert config with kustomize

7. Deploying
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute ``kubectl apply -f digitransit.yml``

8. ???
~~~~~~

Watch ``kubectl get pods``

9. Profit!
~~~~~~~~~~

Access your digitransit instance. Test one route. Test more routes. Look
for edge cases. Have a little âtest suiteâ prepared with standard trips
to check against. Do a little dance :)

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

-  **I see no frequently asked questions?!** â Feel free to ask one :)
-  **I did everything as you say, but when I test bus relations, the route
   is all zigzagging over the map instead of following the road**
   â  Your :term:`GTFS` feed is missing ``shapes.txt``. This happens 
   occasionally, depending on where you get your feed from. See `this blog
   post <https://ulm.dev/2020/01/17/pfaedle/>`__ on how to integrate
   them into your feed yourself

TODO
----

-  try with a "real" kubernetes cluster, not only single node. eg. GKE
-  bring upstream:
